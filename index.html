					<h2>Profile</h2>
					<p>Left my role in Sales and Marketing (and overall wearer of many hats as it goes in the world of startups) to pursue Web-Development full time. Working experience with HTML5, CSS3, Wordpress, Javascript and jQuery.  Through current contract work and personal learning I am building and expanding on these skills daily. Recently completed a bi-weekly Front-End Web Development course through <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/front-end-web-development">General Assembly</a>. I am a quick learner and a determined and self-motivated team player. Currently seeking opportunities that allow me to give back to and learn from and in a team environment to help push a company forward while continuing to grow and expand on my skill set as an entry-level developer.</p>
