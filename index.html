					<h2>Profile</h2>
					<p>Aspiring front-end web developer with a passion for early to mid-stage startups. Recently left my role as Marketing Coordinator (and overall wearer of many hats as it goes in the world of startups) to pursue web-development full time. Experience with HTML, CSS and Wordpress. Currently enrolled in an evening front-end web development class to expand on these skills. I am a quick learner and a determined and self-motivated team player. I consistently seek to achieve the highest level of efficiency and creativity in both company and personal career growth.</p>
